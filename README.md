# **tmmax: High-Performance Transfer Matrix Method with JAX**


![image](docs/logo/logo_tmmax.png)

`tmmax` is a highly optimized Python library for simulating the optical properties of multilayer thin films using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). This library leverages the power of **JAX**, a modern numerical computing library, to deliver high-performance computations, automatic differentiation, and seamless GPU/TPU acceleration. By exploiting JAXâ€™s vectorized operations and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, `tmmax` achieves unprecedented efficiency and speed in modeling complex multilayer systems.


## **Advantages**


- **Speed**: JAX's JIT compilation accelerates TMM calculations, enabling large-scale simulations to run in a fraction of the time compared to traditional methods.
- **Vectorization**: `tmmax` supports vectorized calculations for reflectance and transmittance over multiple wavelengths and angles of incidence, enhancing efficiency during parameter sweeps.
- **Automatic Differentiation**: With JAX's automatic differentiation, `tmmax` can compute gradients efficiently, facilitating the optimization of thin film designs.
- **GPU/TPU Support**: `tmmax` can offload computations to GPUs or TPUs, making it ideal for resource-intensive optical simulations.


## **Benchmarks**

When compared to other libraries such as `tmm` and `vtmm`, `tmmax` stands out due to its superior performance:


## **Installation**

You can install `tmmax` via PyPI:

```bash
pip3 install tmmax
```

## **Usage**

Here is a basic example of how to use `tmmax`:

```python
from tmmax.tmm import tmm

# Define your multilayer stack and simulation parameters

material_list = ["Air", ... , "SiO2", ...]
thickness_list = jnp.array(...)
wavelength_arr  = jnp.array(...)
angle_of_incidences  = jnp.array(...)
polarization = 's' # or 'p'

result = tmm(material_list = material_list,
             thickness_list = thickness_list,
             wavelength_arr = wavelength_arr,
             angle_of_incidences = angle_of_incidences,
             polarization = polarization)
```
